Synopsis:

Sonder is a fox who lost his family at the hands of a hunter, being alone, he had to fend for himself. It's been 1 year since that day and nothing is like before. Food is scarce, forests are cut down and river water is polluted.
Winter is coming and in order to survive, our friend will have to undertake a journey north in search of food.
